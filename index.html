                    <p>
                        Dark and powdery basement expense shaped into tunels of wich the lenth varies from 10 to 30 miles, always making 90Â° turns when ending, unless a staircase apears, wich is not too rare but also not too comon. Some of those tunels have the walls made out of light gray concrete, others, of gray bricks, while the ground of some is made out of a black stone and that of others, of dark wood planks. Eventually, piches of blood with virieble sizes are found on the walls, using to be dry and solid. Bumping into wood-made boxes is very comon, since this level is full of them, and large virety of suplys can be found inside them, but also pices of people in viried stages of whithering.

                            Enigmatic creature who aways looks like a perfect copy of the person who sees it, wearing the clothes they wore upon entering the level regardless if they have been undressed after the entrence, and same goes for hair cut and positioning. If many people look the same Me..., they all see diferent things, copys of themselves taht is, and this is why it is known it is not just an <a href="http://backrooms-wiki.wikidot.com/entity-210" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">impostor</a>. Me... also recives from the personality of who meets them, but only the parts of it that sad meeter tries to hide. It doesn't care if the visitor tries to hide a part of their own mind from other living beens: it is when they try to hide it from themselfs that the entity recives from it. This proprery garanteeds that Me... is awasys going to act like the monster the person who finds it hides inside of them, wich doesn't matter if this monster is really a problam or if it is an imaturity of the visitor wishing to hide it. It is still not knon if there is only one Me... in the level or if many of them wander around those dark tunels, it is one of the questions that have alredy been asked direcly to the creature, but they don't talk like if they were a separeted creature, but as if they actually were the person they are showing the hidden side of, so, they will only anser what the person - the hiden side of them - belives.

                                This creature poses a threat to evry visitor who trys to get suplys from the boxes that fill up this level, and a much more dangerus one than just finding a really stinky head and passing out from nasty. Upon opening a random box, visitors can find an aparently human skull of wich's eyes releace a cyan light, enoughly bright to be seen from a killometer away. Though been a skull, it has the tendency of biting people until slicing them into pices, and it floats.
